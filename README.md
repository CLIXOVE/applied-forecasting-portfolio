# Applied Data Science Portfolio  
**Forecasting, Reliability, and Decision Systems**

Hi, I’m **Yeji Choe**, a Data Scientist specialising in **applied forecasting, model reliability, and decision-focused analytics**.

This portfolio brings together a set of projects that reflect how data science is practiced in real organisations:  
not just building models, but **owning decisions, managing risk, and designing systems that behave safely under uncertainty**.

Rather than optimising for novelty or benchmark scores, these projects emphasise:
- reliability over raw accuracy  
- judgement under stress  
- clarity of decision logic  
- production-style thinking  

---

## Portfolio Focus

Across all projects, I focus on a consistent set of principles:

- **Forecasts are inputs to decisions, not outputs**
- **Average accuracy hides failure modes**
- **Systems should fail gracefully, not silently**
- **Simple, explainable logic often outperforms clever complexity under stress**

The projects span forecasting, evaluation, decision simulation, and data quality, but share a common design philosophy.

## Featured Projects

### 1. Forecast Reliability & Guardrails  
**Repo:** `forecast-reliability-guardrails`

Designing a forecasting system that remains trustworthy during volatile conditions.

- Stress-regime evaluation (peak, hot, cold)
- Rolling reliability monitoring
- Champion–challenger guardrails
- Explicit trade-off between accuracy and safety

**Core signal:** Production reliability, regulated-industry mindset  
→ [View repository](./forecast-reliability-guardrails)

### 2. Decision-Focused Forecasting  
**Repo:** `decision-focused-forecasting`

Translating forecasts into explicit operational decisions and measuring impact.

- Clear decision framing
- Simple, auditable decision rules
- Before/after simulation of outcomes
- Focus on behaviour change, not just prediction quality

**Core signal:** Business impact, product thinking  
→ [View repository](./decision-focused-forecasting)

### 3. End-to-End Forecast Pipeline  
**Repo:** `end-to-end-forecast-pipeline`

Demonstrating ownership of the full data lifecycle.

- Raw data → clean tables → features → models → evaluation
- Data contracts and validation
- Reproducibility and assumptions made explicit

**Core signal:** Engineering empathy, production readiness  
→ [View repository](./end-to-end-forecast-pipeline)

---

### 4. Forecast Model Benchmarking & Trade-offs  
**Repo:** `forecast-model-benchmarking`

Comparing multiple models to understand trade-offs beyond headline accuracy.

- Accuracy vs stability analysis
- Behaviour under stress
- Judgement-driven model selection

**Core signal:** Senior judgement, trade-off reasoning  
→ [View repository](./forecast-model-benchmarking)

---

### 5. Forecasting with Bad Data  
**Repo:** `forecasting-with-bad-data`

Exploring how data issues distort models and how to detect and fix them.

- Missingness and leakage
- Naive vs corrected modelling
- Robust evaluation practices

**Core signal:** Real-world maturity, risk awareness  
→ [View repository](./forecasting-with-bad-data)

## How to Read This Portfolio

Each project follows a consistent structure:

1. **Problem & decision context**
2. **Data assumptions and validation**
3. **Modelling approach**
4. **Evaluation under stress or uncertainty**
5. **Explicit decision or reliability logic**

Notebooks are the primary narrative, supported by reusable code and summary outputs for quick review.

## About Me

**Yeji Choe**  
Data Scientist – Applied Forecasting & Decision Systems  
Auckland, New Zealand  

I’ve worked in environments where models directly influence operational and financial outcomes, and I’m particularly interested in roles that value **ownership, reliability, and thoughtful system design**.

## What This Portfolio Is (and Isn’t)

**This portfolio is:**
- applied and production-oriented  
- focused on reliability and decisions  
- opinionated about trade-offs  

**This portfolio is not:**
- a collection of Kaggle-style optimisations  
- research-heavy or algorithm-first  
- infrastructure- or MLOps-focused  

---

If you’re interested in how forecasting and analytics behave *when the stakes are real*, this portfolio reflects how I approach that work.
