# Applied Forecasting & Decision Systems
**A portfolio of production-oriented data science projects**

Hi, I’m **Yeji Choe**, a Data Scientist specialising in **applied forecasting, model reliability, and decision-focused analytics**.

This repository is the **entry point** to my applied data science portfolio.

The projects linked below reflect how data science is practiced in real organisations:  
not just building models, but **owning decisions, managing risk, and designing systems that behave safely under uncertainty**.

---

## How to Navigate This Portfolio

- This repository is a **hub** (start here)
- Each project lives in its own dedicated repository
- Notebooks are the primary narrative
- Code and structure emphasise **reliability, judgement, and production thinking**

You do **not** need to read everything.  
Each project is designed to stand alone.

## Featured Projects

### 1. Forecast Reliability & Guardrails
**Repo:** `1.-forecast-reliability-guardrails`

Designing forecasting systems that remain trustworthy under volatility.

**What it shows**
- Stress-regime evaluation (peak, hot, cold)
- Rolling reliability monitoring
- Champion–challenger guardrails
- Explicit trade-offs between accuracy and safety

**Signal:** Production reliability, regulated-industry mindset

### 2. Decision-Focused Forecasting
**Repo:** `2.-decision-focused-forecasting` (Private)

Translating forecasts into explicit operational decisions and measuring impact.

**What it shows**
- Clear decision framing
- Simple, auditable decision rules
- Before/after simulation of outcomes
- Focus on behaviour change, not just prediction quality

**Signal:** Business impact, product thinking

---

### 3. End-to-End Forecast Pipeline
**Repo:** `3.-end-to-end-forecast-pipeline` (Private)

Owning the full data lifecycle from ingestion to evaluation.

**What it shows**
- Raw data → clean tables → features → models → evaluation
- Data contracts and validation
- Reproducibility and assumptions made explicit

**Signal:** Engineering empathy, production readiness

---

### 4. Forecast Model Benchmarking & Trade-offs
**Repo:** `4.-forecast-model-benchmarking` (Private)

Understanding trade-offs beyond headline accuracy.

**What it shows**
- Accuracy vs stability analysis
- Behaviour under stress
- Judgement-driven model selection

**Signal:** Senior judgement, trade-off reasoning

---

### 5. Forecasting with Bad Data
**Repo:** `5.-forecasting-with-bad-data` (Private)

How data issues distort models and how to detect them early.

**What it shows**
- Missingness and leakage
- Naive vs corrected modelling
- Robust evaluation practices

**Signal:** Real-world maturity, risk awareness

---

### 6. Data Quality & Trust in Production
**Repo:** `6.-data-quality-trust` (Private)

Ingestion-layer monitoring for real-time telemetry.

**What it shows**
- Timestamp alignment and interval completeness
- Freshness as a gating signal
- Plausibility rules and flatline detection
- Explicit downstream blocking logic

**Signal:** Production maturity, system safety, ingestion reliability

---

## Design Philosophy (Shared Across All Projects)

Across all projects, I consistently apply the following principles:

- **Forecasts are inputs to decisions, not outputs**
- **Average accuracy hides failure modes**
- **Systems should fail gracefully, not silently**
- **Simple, explainable logic often outperforms clever complexity under stress**

These projects are intentionally opinionated and production-oriented.

I’m particularly interested in roles that value **ownership, reliability, and thoughtful system design** in analytics and forecasting systems.

## What This Portfolio Is (and Isn’t)

**This portfolio is:**
- applied and production-oriented  
- focused on reliability and decisions  
- explicit about trade-offs  

**This portfolio is not:**
- Kaggle-style optimisation exercises  
- algorithm-first research projects  
- infrastructure-heavy MLOps demos  

---

If you’re interested in how forecasting and analytics behave **when the stakes are real**, this portfolio reflects how I approach that work.
